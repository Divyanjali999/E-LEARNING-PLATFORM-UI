##Objective:
The objective of this task was to design and develop a clean, responsive, and interactive front-end user interface for an e-learning platform. The goal was to create a multi-page structure that includes course listings, a progress tracking system, and embedded video content—offering a complete and realistic learning experience from a user's point of view.

Description:
This project simulates the front-end structure of an e-learning website using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. It includes three main pages: a dashboard (home), a course listing page, and an individual course view with video playback and progress indication.

The homepage acts as a learner dashboard, displaying personalized progress cards that track course completion using semantic HTML5 <progress> bars. Each progress tracker dynamically reflects different completion percentages and presents a clean, user-centered design.

The course listing page showcases multiple course cards with titles, descriptions, and “Start Course” links. Each card is styled for clarity and accessibility, making it easy for users to scan through and choose what they want to learn. A consistent color scheme and layout give the entire platform a professional and visually appealing feel.

The course detail page features a responsive embedded YouTube video, simulating a real lesson environment. It also includes an updated progress tracker for the current lesson count, reinforcing the sense of advancement and engagement. The structure anticipates expansion into a more dynamic version, which could later include lessons, quizzes, or back-end integrations.

Navigation links across all pages ensure a smooth transition between the homepage, courses, and content. The layout is mobile-friendly and scales well across devices, making the platform accessible from desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

The color palette is calming and education-focused—featuring green accents for progress and trust, white backgrounds for cleanliness, and consistent typography to maintain visual hierarchy.

Conclusion:
This task showcases the ability to design a multi-page, interactive user interface suitable for an online learning platform. It demonstrates practical frontend development skills in structuring responsive layouts, styling with CSS, embedding videos, and simulating progress tracking using semantic HTML components. The project is scalable, maintainable, and ready for future backend integration, fulfilling the deliverable of a styled and interactive learning interface.
